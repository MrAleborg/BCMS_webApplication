# BCMS_webApplication

The Barbados Crisis Management System (BCMS http://www.franckbarbier.com/PauWare/BCMS/) case study is currently implemented as a simple Java application. From this existing material, implement a Java EE/EJB three-tiers application with the following features:

    Revise the current BCMS Java class as a Singleton EJB
    Insert in the Java EE application and connect to the Singleton EJB, Entity EJBs to make data persistent (Apache Derby RDBMS script)
    Create two user interfaces, one for firemen and one for policemen to read data (available fire trucks, police vehicles and routes) and write data (BCMS session with occurred events and execution traces)
